# Transactions App

> This app helps you track expenses you would like to organize and keep track of. For example, if you are a frequent traveler, you can use this app to create a category for traveling and you can add the cost of each trip to your travel category. The app will keep a total of what all of your expenses are and when you click on a category you will receive a breakdown of each of the expenses.
